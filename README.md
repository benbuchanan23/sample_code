# Sample Code for Airbnb Application

## Description
This code was written in Ruby to design a prototype for a simple zoo application structure. I chose to highlight this code, as it demonstrates my skill in object oriented programming, and writing clearly written, DRY, and clean code.

The original prompt for this code was to to create a class design for a "Zoo Animal Categorization Application.".
